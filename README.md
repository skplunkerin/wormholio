# Wormholio

This gem was created to be a one-stop-shop for all file transfer methods that anyone would need to use in their ruby application. 
The current methods I found available were cryptric, and the documentation available for these methods offered no help. 
After creating blog posts on the methods I needed to support ([S3](http://skplunkerin.com/s3-with-ruby-on-rails/) && [FTP, FTPS, SFTP & SCP](http://skplunkerin.com/ftp-ftps-sftp-scp-ruby-on-rails/)), my buddies then recommended converting these classes into a single gem... and so I did.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wormholio'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wormholio
